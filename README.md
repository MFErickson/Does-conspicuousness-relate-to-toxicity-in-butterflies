## Content of the repository


## 1. **Data Folder**
The `data` folder contains:
- The raw data including: a spreadsheet with toxicity data, 2 spreadsheets with dowloaded metrics from the game, and one spreadsheet with the photo legends.
- 2 png files: mars spear and venus mirror symbols for building the images
- Phylogenetic data from kawahara et al. 2023. [https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2008.0758]

## 2. **Image folder**
The `image` folder contains 2 folders with:
- backgrounds: contains all background images used to builde the game
- butterflies: contains butterfly images used to build the game

## 3. **Output**
the folder `output` contains:
- correlation plot between mean detection time and image complexity
- txt file with the output for the background complexity analyses
- txt file with the summary from the brms model
- image of all of the butterfly images filtered by detection time
- image of all dorsal side of butterflies organized by detection time and kill percentage
- image of all ventral side of butterflies organized by detection time and kill percentage
- durga plot with the detection time range of  cryptic and conspicuous butterflies
- smaller version of the above plot
- spreadsheet build from the data spreadsheet that calculates all our variables. For description please see CSV-README.txt of R folder.
- correlation of time range and most cryptic time for conspicuous and cryptic butterflies
- smaller version of the above plot
- image of all of the butterfly images filtered by death porcentage
- Durga plot comparing mean detection time of dorsal and ventral side of images
- Correlation plot of death proportion and dorsal/ventral detection time

## 4. **R** 
the folder `R` contains:
- 13 scripts descrived in the README.txt file
- CSV-README.txt file that describes the variables in the "conspicuoussness.csv" spreadsheet
- download-stats. txt which timestamps when the data was downloaded
- README.txt which describes the scripts on this folder
